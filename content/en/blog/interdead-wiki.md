InterDead now has its own wiki on Fandom.

At this stage, it already documents the core logic of the world and the principles behind the application’s operation — the structural elements on which the project is built. This is not a reference section created “for form’s sake,” but a working space where the internal architecture of InterDead is formalized.

All further changes and refinements will be consistently recorded and documented there. The wiki serves as a point of accumulation and alignment: any adjustments to logic, systems, or terminology are reflected within it, as this structure forms the foundation upon which the narrative of the game we are developing is built.

The wiki does not replace the game itself and does not reveal it in full. It establishes the framework — the level without which coherent development of the world and its internal cause-and-effect relationships would be impossible.
