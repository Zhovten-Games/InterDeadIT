InterDead now maintains its own archive on Fandom.

At present, the archive records the fundamental principles governing the environment and the operational rules of the application — the structural foundations without which the channel cannot function reliably. This archive was not created as a nominal reference or a public showcase; it serves as a working repository in which the internal logic of InterDead is systematically formalized.

All subsequent clarifications, divergences, and corrections will be documented and consolidated there. The archive functions as a point of alignment: any adjustment to terminology, mechanisms, or assumptions is reflected within it, as the continued development of the system and the events associated with it depend on the foundations already recorded.

The archive does not replace InterDead itself. It neither reproduces the experience in full nor claims to be exhaustive. Its purpose is to establish a framework — a level of formalization necessary to preserve the coherence of the environment and the consistency of its causal relations.
