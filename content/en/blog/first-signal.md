The beta grid recorded its first coherent reply last night. Three operators stood by in different time zones, each maintaining a silent channel while we cycled the resonance filters.

### What changed
- A new damping profile keeps the carrier wave steady for longer than 90 seconds.
- The Discord relay now mirrors priority messages with sub-second latency.
- We introduced a fallback prompt that gracefully hands off younger users to the safe demo mode.

### What’s next
We are preparing a closed round of qualitative interviews. If you captured a transcript, please redact personal details and send it through the feedback form. Expect more invitations soon.
