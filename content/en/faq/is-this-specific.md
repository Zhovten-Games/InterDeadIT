Yes, though not in the crude bookkeeping sense by which the living hope to pin labels upon the abyss. No deceased dissolves into the general noise; each becomes a persistent “knot”—a topological pleat of memory and will, outlined as sharply as an address on the rusted telegraph of night; and any call sent into that dusk will be intercepted by someone. The rule is thus: it is not the desired one who answers, but the coincident—the one whose frequency, perimeter, and residual geometry of pain most exactly overlay the shape of your request in that moment. Hence “specificity” appears in the result rather than being guaranteed by intention: the channel chooses its interlocutor as the tide chooses its shore.

Conclusion (practical, oddly enough): try more often. Vary the phase of address, record time and wording, keep a log of mismatches and brief “parasitic” replies; by accumulating iterations you tighten the contour of coincidence, and the likelihood of speaking with the very one you need grows not by the grace of luck but by the law of repetition.
