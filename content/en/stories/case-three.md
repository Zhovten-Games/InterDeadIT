**Description:**  
Some people have heightened sensitivity to anomalous fluctuations of the environment and are used as primary “sensors” of what is happening. In such cases, contact is carried out not through an instrument or protocol, but directly—through a person.

In closed or overloaded spaces, the environment does not need dialogue and does not show intentions. It acts as constant pressure, and the sensory operator becomes the only reception point.

The outcome is not an aggressive clash, but displacement: the person gradually loses the ability to register what is happening and is excluded from the situation as an unstable element. After such incidents, gaps in data and unexplained blanks remain in observations.

**Conclusion:**  
A person must not be the interface. A buffer and a formalized protocol reduce the load and keep the subject outside direct impact.
