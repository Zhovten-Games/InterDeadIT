Elise Rainier treated contact with the other side as an applied discipline. For her, the Further was a working environment—navigable, classifiable, and re-enterable. She knowingly assumed the role of intermediary between threat and those unable to perceive it.

Her death was not accidental but statistically predictable: prolonged exposure to high-risk conditions without full isolation tends toward fatal intersection. Yet her physical absence did not terminate her function.

Rainier remained embedded in the structure of events as a guiding principle—name, method, procedure. She ceased to be a subject and became an orientation.
