The elderly medium participated in the séance as an external consultant, already operating at the limits of physical endurance. The room rejected contact almost immediately, yet inflicted no immediate harm.

She left the house independently, retaining clarity and professional detachment. However, the intervention proved delayed: in the following weeks her condition deteriorated—within explanations typically attributed to age and physiological decline, and therefore raising no formal objections.

Death occurred later and outside the immediate context of the phenomenon, yet the sequence permits its consideration as a consequence, albeit a statistically admissible one.
