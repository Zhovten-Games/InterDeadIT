_(possible ideological fixation)_

**Description:**  
Some specialists go through contact correctly and without immediate consequences. This creates a sense of closure and safety, especially when the practice rests on a strong personal interpretation of what is happening.

However, the absence of system-level recording, logging, and follow-up control makes the effect delayed. The impact may masquerade as a natural deterioration of condition or a “normal” course of events.

In such cases, the specialist survives physically, but loses the ability to properly close the process: the intervention completes itself later, already outside the zone of observation and control.

**Conclusion:**  
Even correct contact requires recording and escort. Without a system, completion occurs when it can no longer be tracked.
