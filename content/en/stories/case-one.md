**Description:**  
Some groups of mediums and researchers build their practice around _demonstrating_ contact. The presence of a camera, an audience, or an external observer becomes not a side effect, but a key condition of what is happening.

In isolated spaces—old sanatoriums, closed houses, places with accumulated memory—this approach stops working. The environment does not enter into dialogue and does not support the scenario; instead, it begins to perceive the presence as unwanted interference.

Loss of orientation and an abrupt interruption of perception in such cases occur not as punishment, but as a consequence of a configuration conflict: the team is flagged by the system as a redundant and unsafe element to be removed.

**Conclusion:**  
Contact designed for an observer is dangerous without a neutral interface that can minimize presence and shift the interaction into background mode.
