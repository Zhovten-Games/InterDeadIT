Holly, whose pulse was a tuning fork for the unseen, entered the farmhouse like a lit Holly possessed heightened sensitivity to anomalous environmental fluctuations, making her a valuable field instrument. Within the isolated farmhouse, that sensitivity proved excessive.

The phenomenon did not communicate or display intent. It manifested as pressure—uniform, impersonal, expulsive. Instruments recorded disturbances without interpretation.

Holly’s disappearance lacked spectacle. What remained was structural absence: disrupted movement, incomplete data, an abruptly terminated record. The house did not kill her in any conventional sense; it merely continued as though she had never been present.
