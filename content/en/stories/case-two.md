**Description:**  
Prolonged practice of contact with the anomalous without stable isolation leads to a gradual erosion of boundaries. Even experienced specialists who treat the Limit as a working environment eventually lose a clear distinction between entry and exit.

Each individual contact may end correctly, but the cumulative effect accumulates. The absence of shielding and full recovery makes transitions irreversible and the state unstable.

Critical outcomes in such cases are rarely sudden. More often, this is the result of prolonged exploitation without a protective perimeter, when the practitioner themself becomes part of the environment with which they continue to work.

Conclusion:
Regular practice requires systemic shielding and a clearly defined exit—without them, even experience becomes a risk factor.
