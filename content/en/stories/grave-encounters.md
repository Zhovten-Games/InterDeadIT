Houston Gray was a medium of an exclusively televisual kind: his practice consisted of rehearsed gestures, calibrated tones, and the expectations of an audience. He did not engage with the phenomenon itself, only affirmed its presence within the frame.

The psychiatric hospital required no such validation. The space reacted not to his statements but to his presence, as a system responding to an invalid element. Disorientation, asphyxiation, and perceptual collapse followed swiftly and without symbolism.

Gray died not because he lied, but because he was functionally empty. His skills had no relevance beyond observation. Where fear is enacted rather than performed, this proved sufficient.
