**Date of update:** 07 Nov 2025

## 1) Who we are and what this site is

This site is an entry point into the meta-universe of the Zhovten Games title and is used solely for artistic and promotional purposes. It is not a real service and not a commercial application. Any mentions of organizations, events, and characters are fictitious.

The site is intended for users 18+ only. If you are under 18, please leave the site.

Right holder: Жовтен Геймс (Zhovten Games).

## 2) Project technologies

The site is built with the static generator Hugo; source code and builds are managed via GitHub; hosting/delivery/protection are provided by Cloudflare (including CDN, Workers, and Cloudflare-level databases). This is standard technical infrastructure; it may process network requests and temporary logs to ensure availability and security.

## 3) What we collect now

We do not create user accounts and do not collect personal data (full name, e-mail, phone, etc.).

To assess interest in site pages we use de-identified analytics, where our reports show only aggregated data by countries/regions without IP addresses and without precise geolocation. When using VPN/proxy, the country may be displayed inaccurately. We do not attempt to de-anonymize users and do not match metrics to a visitor’s identity.

## 4) Planned account functionality (Discord/Telegram)

We plan to launch voluntary sign-in via Discord and/or Telegram. When it is enabled, a record will be created in a Cloudflare database (for example: platform technical identifiers, nickname/login, avatar/link to avatar, a mark of subscription status to our channels/server, record creation/update timestamps).

Such an account is needed solely to open sections for “closed testing/news” and for automatic integration with game content (checking subscription/role and granting corresponding access to interactives). At present this functionality is not used. Upon launch we will update this section, add an account deletion form, and describe retention periods and the exact data fields.

## 5) Cookies and analytics

Technical cookies/web storage may be used as necessary for site operation and aggregated analytics. We do not run targeted advertising and do not perform profiling.

## 6) Transfer of data to third parties

We do not sell and do not transfer personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. Technical data may be processed by infrastructure providers (see §2) within the scope of hosting/security services.

## 7) External platforms

We directly work with and publish materials on: LinkedIn, Discord, Telegram. These platforms have their own rules and privacy policies. If the list of services is expanded, we will explicitly update this section.

## 8) Legal grounds and security

Processing of de-identified metrics and technical data is performed on the basis of the legitimate interest of the site owner—maintaining operability and improving content. We apply organizational and technical measures to protect the project’s infrastructure.

## 9) Your choices

You may limit cookies and tracking via your browser settings/extensions—the site will remain available, although some functions may behave differently. After the account feature is launched, there will be tools for managing your account (view/delete).

## 10) Changes to this policy

As the project evolves (including launching sign-in), we will update this text on this page with the date indicated.
