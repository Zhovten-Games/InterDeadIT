**Date of update:** 07 Nov 2025

## 1) Who we are and subject of the Agreement

This site is an entry point into the meta-universe of the Zhovten Games title, used for artistic and promotional purposes. It is not a real service and not a commercial application. Participation on the site constitutes acceptance of these Terms.

The site is intended for users 18+ only. If you are under 18, please leave the site.

Right holder: Zhovten Games (Жовтен Геймс).

## 2) Technical infrastructure and access

The site is built with the static generator Hugo; development and builds are run via GitHub; hosting/delivery/protection are provided by Cloudflare (including CDN, Workers, and Cloudflare-provided databases). Availability depends on external platforms and the network; the service is provided “as is” and “as available.”

## 3) Accounts and integrations (planned)

Voluntary sign-in via Discord and/or Telegram is planned. When this feature is enabled, a record will be created in a Cloudflare database (platform technical identifiers, nickname/login, link to avatar, a flag for subscription/role status, record creation/update timestamps).

The purpose is to open access to the “closed testing/news” sections and ensure automatic integration with game content (subscription/role checks).

The feature is not active yet. Details of data processing are set out in the Privacy Policy; upon launch there will also be a procedure for deleting an account and retention periods.

## 4) Content rights and license

All site materials (texts, graphics, prototypes, lore elements, etc.) are protected by law and belong to Zhovten Games, or are used on lawful grounds.

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license for personal, non-commercial use of the site (viewing/reading). Prohibited: copying “as is” for commercial purposes, modification, reverse engineering, circumvention of technical measures, and other abusive exploitation.

## 5) Rules of conduct

Actions that may harm the site/users/infrastructure are prohibited: attempts to hack, injection of malicious code, traffic flooding, bypassing authorization/roles, and unauthorized data collection.

## 6) External platforms and links

We directly operate and publish materials on: LinkedIn, Discord, Telegram. These services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies; review them separately. By following external links, you act at your own risk. If the list of services is expanded, we will explicitly update this section.

## 7) Analytics, cookies, and privacy

We use de-identified, aggregated analytics (e.g., by countries/regions; when using a VPN, data may be inaccurate). See the Privacy Policy for details. Technical cookies/web storage may be used for site operation and metrics.

## 8) No warranties and limitation of liability

The site and materials are provided “as is.” To the extent permitted by applicable law, Zhovten Games is not liable for indirect, incidental, punitive damages, loss of data or profits, or for failures caused by external platforms and networks.

## 9) Changes to the Terms

We may update the Terms as the project evolves. The current version is published on this page with the date indicated.
