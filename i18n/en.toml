— Is communion with a specific dead person possible?
Yes, though not in the crude bookkeeping sense by which the living hope to pin labels upon the abyss. No deceased dissolves into the general noise; each becomes a persistent “knot”—a topological pleat of memory and will, outlined as sharply as an address on the rusted telegraph of night; and any call sent into that dusk will be intercepted by someone. The rule is thus: it is not the desired one who answers, but the coincident—the one whose frequency, perimeter, and residual geometry of pain most exactly overlay the shape of your request in that moment. Hence “specificity” appears in the result rather than being guaranteed by intention: the channel chooses its interlocutor as the tide chooses its shore.

Conclusion (practical, oddly enough): try more often. Vary the phase of address, record time and wording, keep a log of mismatches and brief “parasitic” replies; by accumulating iterations you tighten the contour of coincidence, and the likelihood of speaking with the very one you need grows not by the grace of luck but by the law of repetition. Regularity is the chief candle in this anachronistic laboratory.

## Welcome

InterDead is a psychologically oriented horror project by Zhovten Games within speculative fiction (SpecFi): a story about a messenger for the dead, around which a meta-universe is growing. This site is the entry point into it.

The universe also develops through multiple authors and planned tabletop role-playing sessions.

Everything you see beyond this screen is written “in character” — from the perspective of the messenger’s creator, a socially awkward researcher who sincerely tries to follow “marketing rules” while selling his tool and reliably produces cringe.

We describe in detail how the idea of the world and the game currently in development was born in the [first chapter of the cycle “Echo of an Unfading Memory”](/about/) — our extended “About”.

You can read more about the structure of the universe, terminology, and techno-lore in the [InterDead Wiki on Fandom](https://interdead.fandom.com/wiki/InterDead_Wiki).

If you need to step outside the fiction, the legal documents and contact information are available below. Please note that this is a non-commercial project.
